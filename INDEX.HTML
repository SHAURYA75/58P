Some times when you need to feel calm some meditation music can help in doing so a lot.It's just fun to do nothing and just relax and listen to music, it might not sound fun but it is, but hey, you might have a different perspective about it and I'm just telling you mine because maybe you don't like music at all or you may like to jog or run or walk while listening to it.</p></section></body></html>
